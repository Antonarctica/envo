EnvO is a community ontology for the concise, controlled description of environments.

The main website is here:
http://environmentontology.org/

The ontology PURLs are:

  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.owl
  * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/envo.obo

Currently the contents of the OBO-Format and OWL versions are semantically identical, but in the future the OBO-Format may contain a subset of what is available in the OWL.
